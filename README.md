# CodeLeap project

</div>

## 🔎 Overview

**project_codeleap** is an application that performs CRUD functions and it was developed as a code test for a **Junior Backend** position at [**CodeLeap**](https://codeleap.co.uk/).

The design of this application is available [in this link.](https://www.figma.com/design/0OQWLQmU14SF2cDhHPJ2sx/CodeLeap-Engineering-Test?node-id=33054-16&t=Cfd1CyqkJrJo84XO-0)

## ✅ Bonus points

For the purpose of gaining bonus points, I have made the function **comments**, just to challenge myself something more than required.

I have also created a simple **authentication** with JWT, just to make it like a production API.

> If you wish to test with postman, I will leave a lin to download my collection already configured. [**Drive repo**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SrguPPkMjkyHvAV4PK5Jw9JWPR1ML6Fv?usp=sharing)

## 💪 Difficulties overcome

It was the first time I used **Python** and **Django** in a project. Previously I have developed with **Golang(GO)** and **.NET**, so i lost a little bit of time to learn how to use these new tools and rush against time to deliver this project as soon as possible

## 📈 Things to improve

These are things that I would have done if time was not a prime factor for this deliver:

- Error treatment (that would be the most immediate action);
- Make more funcionalities, to a complete system;

Nevertheless, I believe I delivered a very well developed API RESTful , which is a great accomplishment when considering I have spent little more than a day to finish the application, in a language that i never used before.
